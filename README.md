## Hi, it's Shafikul. I've been thinking about this project for a long time, but due to playing CTFs, I hardly got time. Now I have a purpose to do it.
### My first task is making a phishing link checker scanner. It feels like hitting two birds with one stone! ðŸ˜Š I also feel the need to create a phishing link scanner due to the increasing number of scam emails these days.

#### I'm considering integrating some packages like Nmap or creating a crawler that scans websites and checks their legitimacy. Letâ€™s build it! If you have any ideas on how to improve it, feel free to help. ðŸ˜„
